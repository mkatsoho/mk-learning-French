## How-to-learn, advised by KOLs
How-to-learn is really a helpful topic, but it is NEVER the key to unlock the door to Paris. Instead, keep speaking and expressing in French in your daily life.

# Suffix
## The goal
Learning French by yourself without paying $s, €s, or ¥s.

This is just an index to save your time to find materials here or there. 


## The book I learnt
Here is the book I learnt. 

You do NOT need to have this book. Since, following its contents, I found out and share similar but FREE videos here. 

Promenades 3rd Edition, by James G. Mitchell and Cheryl Tano. I brought one used in 15$.

Promenades 4th Edition, is https://vistahigherlearning.com/store/promenades-4th-edition.html

There are not quite big changes between them I think.

## The videos I used

Most of videos are from Youtube. I select the most favourate ones and list here to save your time to dig out. 

I also provide key words as each section's title, so you can search other docuemnts or videos if you like.
